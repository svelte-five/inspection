Dev mode, frontend logging library for svelte with support for elimination in production.

A small logging utility for frontend development in svelte. It prints nothing in non-dev environments and functions get eliminated during bundling for non-dev environments.

## Usage
Install:
```shell
pnpm add @svelte-five/inspection
```

Import the relevant logging method:
```ts
import { info, debug, warn, error } from '@svelte-five/inspection'

debug('The identifier is 1')
info('Loaded local storage.')
error(new Error('Failed to fetch data.'))
warn({ msg: 'This is a warning.' })
```

These functions will be eliminated by your builder in production and in case your builder doesn't support auto elimination, they will produce no output based on the following condition:
```ts
const isActive = import.meta.env['VITE_SVELTE_INSPECTION'] || import.meta.env['DEV']
```
